    "First, follow the instructions provided in `ucloud.md`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have done that, let's look at how to use the repository with course materials. First, log in to https://github.com and go to the repository's link: https://github.com/rbroc/NLP-AU-23. \n",

    "##### Forking the repository\n",
    "Click on `Fork` (top-right of the page). This creates a copy of the repository which is partly independent of the original repository. You will be submitting changes to *this* repository. \n",
    "The original repository will be iteratively updated with new materials or exercises. You can sync the two by setting them both as *remotes* in your local instance of the repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Cloning the repository and setting up remotes\n",
    "With the VS Code app on UCloud open, and a Terminal open, you can clone your repository by `cd`-ing into your private folder, and running: \n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/your_username/NLP-AU-23\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can visualize your remotes by typing: `git remote -v`.\n",
    "You should add my repository as a remote, by running:\n",
    "```\n",
    "git remote add [robertas_remote_name] https://github.com/rbroc/NLP-AU-23.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "`robertas_remote_name` can be anyting, e.g., `roberta`, or `original_repo`...\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Our workflow\n",
    "As my repository gets updated, you can pull it into yours by running:\n",
    "```\n",
    "git pull [robertas_remote_name] https://github.com/rbroc/NLP-AU-23.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can push to your remote by typing:\n",
    "```\n",
    "git push origin [branch_name]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have done this, our workflow will be the following:\n",
    "- You run the github setup script (and log in with your token if needed)\n",
    "- You go to your local repo\n",
    "- You pull my repo\n",

    "A good way to manage dependencies for specific projects and avoid conflicts is to create virtual environments (which contain bundles of libraries that you can \"activate\" and \"deactivate\" at will, without those interfering with your global environment). I tend to keep my virtual environments in the same place, e.g., my private folder on UCloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a virtual enviroment.\n",
    "1. Navigate to your private folder (`path_to_folder`)\n",
    "2. Create a virtual environment folder, e.g., by running `mkdir venvs`\n",
    "3. Create a new virtual environment (`nlp-e23`), by running:\n",
    "`python -m venv path_to_folder/venvs/nlp-e23`\n",
    "4. You can activate it by running: `source path_to_folder/nlp-e23/bin/activate`\n",
    "5. To deactivate it, you can simply run: `deactivate`\n",
    "\n",
